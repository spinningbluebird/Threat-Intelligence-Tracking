__JOKER MALWARE SUMMARY__
Joker malware has been present on the Google Play store since 2017. According to Google, it has removed more than 1700 Android apps that have been infected with Joker. On September 2nd, 2020 6 more applications on the Play store totaling 200,000+ downloads have been discovered to be infected by Joker. The newest applications discovered are Safety AppLock, Convenient Scanner 2, Push Message-Texting&SMS, Emoji Wallpaper, Fingertip GameBox, and Separate Doc Scanner. 
 
The Joker malware presents itself as a legitimate application on the Play store. Once installed the application begins to conduct billing fraud by sending SMS messages to a premium rate number or by using the victim's account to make purchases using WAP billing that go towards Joker's operators. 
 
Google stated that in several cases, Joker operators have been able to bypass the Play store's defenses by submitting clean apps and then later adding the malicious functions once the application has been approved. 
 
The Joker malware appears to use AES, XOR, Blowfish, and DES to encrypt their strings. Joker attempts to obfuscate its encrypted strings by using substrings (.append (".cli" .append("ck)) and delimiters to break up keywords. Joker also uses command and control servers to deliver content and retrieve billing details. The malicious apps will check which carrier the phone is using and then fetch a configuration object from its command and control server for that specific carrier. 
 
Joker operators appear to submit fake reviews to their malicious applications in order to gain a false sense of authenticity. These reviews are often followed by real reviews from actual users.
 
The most concerning aspect of Joker malware is the operator's ability to change and address new security restrictions on the platform. For example, when Google implemented stricter permissions for apps that wanted access to a device's SMS function, the operators moved onto using WAP fraud instead. The application also has the ability to solve basic CAPTCHAs like text and number capturing. Google has made note that the operators have "at some point used just about every cloaking and obfuscation technique under the sun in an attempt to go undetected". 
 
For resolution, Google urges its users to remove any of the infected applications that remain on devices.
