On August 10th, 2020 a security alert published by Autodesk detailed a malicious plugin called 'PhysXPluginMfx". The plugin abused MAXScript (scripting utility that ships the 3Ds Max software) and if loaded inside 3Ds, the plugin would run malicious code that would then propagate and infect other MAX files on Windows systems. When reviewed by BitDefender on August 26th, BitDefender stated the purpose of the plugin was to deploy a backdoor trojan that actors could use to search infected computers for sensitive files and information. BitDefender was able to confirm the malware was in the wild and had attacked a video production company.  

When BitDefender reviewed the malware, they stated the malware uses a command and control server found to be located in South Korea. BitDefender stated they found connections to the CnC from South Korea, United States, Japan, and South Korea which suggests there are unconfirmed victims in the mentioned countries.  

The plugin that abuses 3Ds Max software is thought to be created by a new hacker group that is targeting companies across the globe. Bitdefender reported this is the second incident where a group has created malware for Autodesk. The security firm was not able to find any evidence suggesting that group and this one are connected.  

Reviewing the malware and its operations, the plugin "PhysXPluginMfx" communicates with its CnC server where it downloads other scripts used to collect information and download content. The software also communicates collected information on the user to the CnC. One of the files downloaded is able to take screenshots, collect passwords and gather history from Chrome browser.  

The following toolset is used by this group: 
HdCrawler 
Used to list, compress, and upload specific files.  
		
HddUnpacker 
Used to decrypt and decompress the files uploaded by HdCrawler 
		
Infostealer 
Performs rate-limited, screen capturing, information collecting, and ties itself to a specific user. 
		
If a machine is thought to be compromised, there are several indicators that can help identify a compromise:
	
Connections between the host and 175.197.40.61 	
The programs "HdCrawler", "HddUnpacker", and "Infostealer" being ran on the host 
Previous plugins having been deleted from AutoDesk 	
New plugins the user didn't download in AutoDesk 
	
AutoDesk published its recommendations for this exploit, suggesting that users download the latest version of Security Tools for Autodesk in order to identify and remove the software.
