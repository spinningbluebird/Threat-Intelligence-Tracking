On October 15, 2020 the Department of Justice released information relating to a group that was responsible for providing money laundering services to several threat actor groups. Fourteen members of the group "QQAAZZ" were charged in Pennsylvania for conspiring to launder money stolen from victims of computer fraud, bringing the total to 20 after 6 other members of the group were previously charged in 2019 and early 2020. According to the DOJ, in Bulgaria a bitcoin mining operation associated with the group was also seized. Furthermore, several law enforcement agencies in Europe (16 countries total) collaborated with the US in investigations and prosecuting members of QQAAZZ in Europe. 
According to the report by the DOJ, the group has been in operation since 2016. Among QQAAZZ's clients involved those who distributed Dridex, Trickbot, and GozNym.
